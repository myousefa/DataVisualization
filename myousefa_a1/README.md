# Objective
In this project we are given a data set. The objective is to create a static image of the data to tell a story. It should have exceptional design elements and accurately display the data that answers a bigger question based on the data and incorporates design elements that are suited to the infromation. 

# The Big Question
The number one question I want to answer here is:
- What was the number of sunshine hours every month of the year on average from 1981-2010.

I wanted to find also answer but did not get the chance to finish my visualization that answers this question:
- What relationship does sunshine days have to the geographical longitude and latitude?

# My process
The first thing I did was look at the data. I wanted to see what relationships I could build based on what was given. The first thing I thought was to build a relatiobship of sunshine hours per month to longitude/latitude. I thought this was the route I would take but I could not figure out how to plot this relationship and is something I definitely will continue to work on. 

After some brainstorming I figured that I could plot sunshine hours per month with labeled cities from 1981-2010. This tells a strightforward story of how many sunshine hours a city had per month on average from 1981-2010.

When it came to designing a visualization I wanted to begin with something I am somewhat familiar with. In my past I have used Python libraries such as mathplotlib but with limited expereince. I quickly got to doing research and got a quick model up and running. 

The first design choice I made was to make my x-axis the month of the year and the y axis the average sunshine hours. Next I had to plot the data. This process included rendering the data and processing it. During the processing part it becomes a lot easier to use the data to plot. Although some challenges came around, I managed to get it all plotted. The information became quickly became jumbled and here came my next design choice. 

I added colors to the lines. This creates visual interest and an easy to understand model. Color coding the different cities meant I had to add a legend. I created a legend and ran into a challenge. I could not remember which color represented what city so I had to work backwards to figure that out. After some reverse working I was able to get it all put together and put into the legend. 

All these design elements help to effectively communicate the data at hand and can quickly help notice the trends. The trends being, there is more sunshine hours during the Summer months. Winter has the least sunshine hours. You can also notice a pickup of more and more sunshine days during Spring and less and less as Summer ends and moves into Fall. 

One thing I feel my visualization may skew is the fact the lines are connected. This may imply I have data from all 365 days of the year but the reality is I do not. Although I feel this is actually quite dangerous to the data I was more interested in the visual aspect of the data. It did not make any sense to use this as a scatter plot since it would look like just dots right on top of another.
